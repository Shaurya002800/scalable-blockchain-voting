# Circuits

Planned circuits:

- `ballot_validity.circom`: prove one valid candidate selection and bind the
  proof to the election, ciphertext, and ballot nullifier.
- `batch_validity.circom`: prove ballot validity, nullifier uniqueness, state
  transition, and aggregate consistency for a committed batch.
- `tally_proof.circom`: bind accepted batches, aggregate ciphertext,
  decryption shares, election configuration, and published totals.

No circuit is implemented yet. A hash placeholder must not be presented as a
SNARK.
