# Demo architecture

## Target flow

```text
eligibility proof
  -> election-scoped identity
  -> ephemeral voting key
  -> encrypted ballot package
  -> ballot validity proof
  -> IPFS/content-addressed storage
  -> batch manifest and Merkle roots
  -> on-chain batch commitment
  -> encrypted aggregation
  -> threshold decryption shares
  -> tally proof
  -> on-chain verifier
```

## What the current contracts establish

### `ElectionConfig`

Creates immutable election parameters: election ID, candidate-list hash,
public-key hash, and voting window.

### `VoterRegistry`

Provides a trusted registrar seam for the first demo. The registrar records an
election-scoped identity nullifier and an ephemeral voting address. It does not
verify Anon Aadhaar yet, and it must not be described as anonymous eligibility
proof verification.

It also exposes a proof-based registration seam through
`IEligibilityVerifier`. The verifier statement is:

- the registrant is eligible for this election;
- the proof is bound to this `electionId`;
- the proof authorizes this election-scoped `identityNullifier`; and
- the proof binds that nullifier to one ephemeral `votingKey`.

The current repository includes only a test verifier for this seam. It is not
an Anon Aadhaar verifier.

The TypeScript crypto package mirrors the registry's public-input hash so the
future frontend or Anon Aadhaar adapter can build the exact same proof signal
off-chain before calling `registerWithProof`.

Registration should be submitted by a relayer or registrar. An identifiable
wallet should not mint a public credential and register its voting key in the
same transaction.

### `VotingContract`

Provides a direct, one-transaction-per-ballot commitment path for contract
testing. It verifies that the sender is the registered ephemeral voting
address and rejects reused ballot nullifiers. It stores only a content digest,
not the vote or encrypted package.

This is a reference path, not the scalable batch path.

### `BatchCommitment`

Records an append-only sequence of CID Merkle roots, nullifier roots, and
manifest digests. It enforces an authorized batcher and continuity from the
previous nullifier root.

It does **not** prove:

- that every ballot proof is valid;
- that all nullifiers inside a batch are unique;
- that no valid ballot was omitted;
- that the manifest remains available; or
- that the encrypted aggregate matches the committed ballots.

A batch-validity/nullifier-state proof is required to remove this trust.

### `packages/crypto`

Defines the off-chain vote-package and batch-manifest formats used before data
is submitted to `BatchCommitment`. Vote packages intentionally exclude
timestamps, device IDs, client versions, and other fingerprinting metadata.

The package currently provides secp256k1 EC-ElGamal-style encrypted vote
vectors, deterministic public-key hashes, ballot-proof public-input hashing,
local demo decryption, homomorphic aggregation helpers, deterministic hashes,
Merkle roots, inclusion receipts, and duplicate-nullifier checks.

It still does not prove ballot validity, prove batch validity, or perform
threshold decryption. Those pieces need real circuits and verifier contracts.

### `TallyVerifier`

Accepts a tally only after an external verifier contract returns `true` for
the proof and public-input hash. No verifier is included yet, so verified tally
publication remains intentionally unavailable.
